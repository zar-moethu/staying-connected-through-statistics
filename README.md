# ðŸ“ž What Does Statistics Say About Calls to Home?
_Using statistics to tell a story of love, distance, and connection._

## âœ¨ 1. Overview
Calls to Home is a personal analytics project where I tracked 20 days of phone calls with my parents while living away from them here in New Zealand.

Maintaining strong family ties while living abroad has always been important to me â€” because my why for coming here has always been my family. 
While Iâ€™m working hard to grow in my career, my motivation has always been my family. Theyâ€™ve been my reason _"my why"_. 
Itâ€™s not just about chasing success; itâ€™s about sharing the journey with them, making them part of every step, and honouring the reason I started in the first place. 
Staying connected with my parents continues to be a grounding force, bridging the distance and bringing comfort to us all.

nspired by this bond, I chose to track 20 days of phone calls with my parents â€” turning everyday moments into data, and then applying statistical methods to uncover patterns in something deeply personal.
This project examines  statistics and data storytelling using R â€” a small dataset, a big emotional impact.
